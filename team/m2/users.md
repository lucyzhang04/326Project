# Target Users

## Primary Audience
The primary users of our web application, **Connect.me**, are teenager, young adult, and adult users of Spotify who want to explore strangers' spotify interest as well as friends' spotify interest corresponding to a prompt/quote, and share their latest spotify fixation. They are expected to be the general public, from all walks of life who are technologically adept. Our application will cater to teenagers, who often like exploring their friends' and their peers' song preferences. Similarly, our application will cater to young adults and adults who are curious and like exploring general public's as well as their friends' podcast and song preferences. Users can benefit by feeling socially more connected to the general public's as well as their friend's podcast and/or song listening trends.

## User Needs
<!-- NEED TO CHECK PROBLEM.MD FOR BETTER RELEVANCE -->
All humans on God's green earth benefit from feeling socially connected, including our primary audience. Teenagers face the challenge of needing social connections with their peers and fitting in. They need means to socially connect and feel like a part of a community. Many look for tools that are intuitive, fun to use, and enable easy connection with others on both mobile and desktop devices, and can seamlessly integrate into their daily routines.

Young adults and adults often face the challenge of not being able to easily feel connected to their friends due to busy work schedules, and due to not having their friends from earlier walks of life in close proximity (as they may relocate for work). They need a means to feel socially connected to their friends they seldom meet due to clashing schedules, as well as their long distance friends. Many, therefore, also look for tools that are intuitive, fun to use, and enable easy connection with others on both mobile and desktop devices, and can seamlessly integrate into their daily routines.
