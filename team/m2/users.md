## User Needs
<!-- NEED TO CHECK PROBLEM.MD FOR BETTER RELEVANCE -->
All humans benefit from feeling socially connected. Teenagers, in particular, face the challenge of needing to connect with peers and feel a sense of belonging. They seek platforms that are intuitive, fun, and allow them to easily engage with others, both on mobile and desktop devices, while seamlessly fitting into their daily routines.

Similarly, young adults and adults often struggle to maintain social connections due to busy work schedules and the distance that comes with relocating for jobs. They need ways to stay connected with friends they rarely see due to conflicting schedules, as well as those who live far away. Like teenagers, they look for tools that are easy to use, enjoyable, and help them stay in touch across different devices, effortlessly blending into their busy lives.

## Why These Users Matter
These user groups are vital to the success of Connect.me because they are at key life stages where social connection plays an important role. For teenagers, feeling connected is crucial for their development and has a positive impact on their mental health.

Similarly, young adults and adults benefit from social connection, which significantly improves their mental health, long-term happiness, and overall quality of life.

By catering to the unique needs of these groups, Connect.me aims to provide both short-term and long-term solutions that help users stay connected with friends, peers, and even strangers throughout different phases of life, making the app both relevant and impactful.
