## Upload a Song or Podcast
On the website's landing page, users can search for a song or podcast using a search bar. After submitting their query, a list of matching results will be displayed on the screen, fetched via one or more API calls to the Spotify REST API. Users can then select one of the displayed results, and their selection will be carried over to the next screen. This enables the main functionality of the application, which is to let users view each other's daily selections in a scrollable feed.
