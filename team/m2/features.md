## Upload a Song or Podcast
On the website's landing page, users can search for a song or podcast using a search bar. After submitting their query, a list of matching results will be displayed on the screen, fetched via one or more API calls to the Spotify REST API. Users can then select one of the displayed results, and their selection will be carried over to the next screen. This enables the main functionality of the application, which is to let users view each other's daily selections in a scrollable feed.

## Recommendation Feed
After uploading a song or podcast, the user will be brought to the dashboard. This dashboard will contain a section describing the top 5 songs/podcasts that users contributed, as well as widgets that represent individual responses. This will allow users to see the most popular contributions and further explore podcast series and/or albums.

## Daily Analytics
Above the recommendation feed, users can view the top 5 songs or podcasts of the day, along with the number of people who recommended each one. This helps users discover popular or trending content, which can lead to better recommendations. 

**Assigned to:**

## Widgets of User Responses
These widgets represent individual contributions; these will contain an image (likely an album cover or podcast cover image) as well as an identifier (ie: the user's name that is entered when uploading their response).
