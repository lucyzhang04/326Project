# Problem Statement 
Today, there are numerous social platforms that allow users to interact with each other, connect, & find common ground. However, these social platforms typically revolve around sharing images, career updates, & personal content. Music is an integral part of people's daily lives, and one does not need to be immersed in the world of music to find comfort in it. We want to allow users to connect with each other through the shared love of music and podcasts. 

## Proposed Solution 
To help facilitate the interaction between users, we will prompt users to respond with a song or podcast that they feel connects to our daily quote/theme. Additionally, the application will not allow users to access their own feed or what songs/podcasts are currently trending in relation to the daily prompt. We do this to ensure that we promote connection & collaboration, boost user engagement, and avoid the harmful, addictive side effects of social media.

To accomplish this, these are our key features:
 **- Daily quote display**
 **- Upload of song/podcast**
 **- Daily analytics**
 **- Recommendation feed from other users**
 **- Daily refresh of feed**

## Why This Matters
This application and along with its features will encourage a collaborative and interactive environment between users revolving around a shared passion and love for music and podcasts. Furthermore, we add the aspect of necessary daily contribution and a refresh of a user's feed daily so that users can constantly explore and discover new music and podcasts, giving them a reason to hop on remind.me daily.
