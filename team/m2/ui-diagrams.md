# UI Diagrams 

## Prompt and Upload Screen
The prompt and upload features the quote/theme of the day and an input area for the user's username and the user's submission. The user will submit a song/podcast they feel reminds them/relates to the quote/theme of the day. The user is not able to view or access their feed or the trending section until they make a contribution for the quote/theme of the day. Additionally, the user is only able to make submission each day.
