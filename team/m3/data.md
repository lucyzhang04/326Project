## Data Relationships
- **Recommendation to track/episode:** One-to-one relationship (each recommendation is associated with exactly one track or episode)
## Data Sources
- **User-Input Data**: The user will directly input their name in a text form. Spotify song data will be generated through user interactions using SAPI calls.
- **Third-party API**: Spotify's API will generate the bulk of the data that we use in the app.
