# Application Features

## Daily Theme/Quote Display

The landing page of the website will display a new daily theme, particularly a phrase, quote or sentence, for which users can upload a song or podcast that they feel best aligns with the daily theme. Every day, the theme will be updated (tentatively at 12:00am EST) for all platform users in order to inspire regular contributions and thereby boost user engagement. In a given day, users will upload media for the same theme, establishing a collaborative platform environment.

## Daily Refresh of Feed

The theme is updated daily (tentatively at 12:00am EST) for all platform users. In turn, the feed displaying user response widgets must be "refreshed" as well. The recommendation feed will display the new user responses for the updated daily theme. Put simply, it will be cleared daily, accepting and populating entirely new responses/recommendations.

## Song/Podcast Upload

On the website's landing page, users can search for a song or podcast using a search bar. After submitting their query, a list of matching results will be displayed on the screen, fetched via one or more API calls to the Spotify REST API. Users can then select one of the displayed results, and their selection will be carried over to the next screen. This enables the main functionality of the application, which is to let users view each other's daily selections in a scrollable feed.

As of Milestone 3, we are mocking the song search using static data. This feature includes considerable thought and integration with other features, as each stage of the form leads to additional data being loaded, displayed, and stored.

## Spotify Query

The Spotify Query implements the Spotify Web API and uses Express.js to query specific songs from Spotify. This will be integrated further with the frontend in milestone 4. Specifically, when users type in a song in the input field on the front screen, they will be able to select one of the displayed results that has been generated by the spotify query and that data will be saved.

For milestone 3, we have the spotify query folder separate from the rest of the frontend development. They will be integrated when we work more on the backend in milestone 4.

Currently, the spotify query is able to search for songs in Spotify that have been requested within the code (currently it asks for songs with the name "Sweet Nothing"). Remind.Me is registered as a web app for Spotify. We have a redirect URI: http://localhost:8888/callback; when launched, the web app simply displays the lists of songs and the respective artists that match the query request.

## Navigation Bar 
Users can navigate between the "Feed," "Trending," and "Saved" pages by clicking hyperlinks in the navigation bar. The navigation bar will visually indicate the active tab and include a hover effect for each tab to enhance interactivity. Additionally, the navigation bar will adapt its layout to fit maximized screens.

## Recommendation Feed

After uploading a song or podcast, the user will be brought to the personal feed screen. This page will display widgets representing songs that you and other users have contributed. At the top of the page, there is the navigation bar as described above. Every time another user contributes a song/podcast entry, the feed will be updated with the recommendations. As well, when the quote resets, the recommendation feed will be cleared. 

- **Song/Podast Widgets:**

  These widgets represent individual contributions; these will contain an image (likely an album cover or podcast cover image) as well as an identifier (ie: the user's name that is entered when uploading their response).       This will allow users to visualize the activity and see updates as other users contribute.

## Trending Page
On the trending page, a user can view the top 5 songs or podcasts of the day, along with the number of people who recommended each one. Each song or podcast will be represented by an image icon (either an album cover or podcast cover). This helps users discover popular or trending content, which can lead to better recommendations.

- **Analytics Table:**
  
  This will display the top 5 shared songs/podcasts. The analytics bar interfaces with the server-side database and fetches the top songs/podcasts.

- **Like Button:**

  For each entry in the trending table, users are able to "like" the entry. When a user clicks the like button, the entry is added to an indexedDB instance such that the data can be displayed on the saved songs/podcast page.   (3 points)

  If the song is in the indexedDB instance, an alert will indicate that the song has been added to the saved respository. Otherwise, the song is already liked, and an alert will indicate that the song is already a liked        item. (2 points)

- **Daily Reset of Trending:**
  When the daily refresh of the quote/feed occurs, a Reset event will be published and the trending screen will reset--thereby clearing the table.

## Saved Page
Users can like songs or podcasts on the "Trending" and "Feed" pages. Any songs or podcasts they like will appear on the "Saved" page. This page filters the full list of songs and podcasts to display only the ones the user has liked.

- **Analytics Table:**
  - The user's liked songs/podcasts are retrieved from an IndexedDB instance. These cached results are displayed in an analytics table. The table updates dynamically when new songs/podcasts are added to the database (3 points).
  - Specific care is taken to avoid displaying duplicate songs on the Saved Page. This is done by enforcing a primary key constraint on the combination of a song/podcast title and the artist/host in the IndexedDB instance (2 points).
