- **Task(s)**: Uploaded png file for UI diagram and filled out corresponding ui-diagram.md file.
- **Details**: I uploaded the png file for the UI diagram I made for the first screen of the web application. I used figma to outline the first screen. The screen displays the daily quote/theme and then features two input boxes for the username and user submission. Then, I edited the ui-diagram.md file to explain my process in creating the ui diagram for the first screen.
